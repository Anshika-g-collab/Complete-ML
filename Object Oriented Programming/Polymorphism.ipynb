    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated  as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces.\n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design . It enables a single functions to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementation of a method. By understanding and applying polymorphism, we can create more extensible and maintainable Object-Oriented Programs."
